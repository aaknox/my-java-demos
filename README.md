## Prerequisites & Learning Objectives
The [setup page](./setup.md) has instructions on setting up your local environment for Java development.

Before starting with the material in this repository, associates should be familiar with:
* General programming concepts - control flow statements, basic data structures and algorithms
* Basic terminal commands - `cd`, `mv`, `cp`, and `rm`

After completing all the modules in this repository, associates should be able to:
* Understand Java as a programming language, as well as its similarities to and differences from other languages
* Write syntactically correct Java code, compile it, and run the program on the command line
* Understand and apply object-oriented principles and design patterns
* Know when and how to utilize the Java Collections API effectively
* Understand the String, StringBuilder, and StringBuffer APIs and how Strings are handled in Java
* Understand and utilize threads to create multi-threaded programs
* Read and write data to files
* Understand and explain garbage collection
* Utilize the Reflections API to inspect and modify the behavior of objects at runtime
* Explain the importance of unit testing as well as write effective unit tests with JUnit
* Explain what Maven is, its benefits, and how to use it
* Utilize Java 8 features such as functional interfaces, lambda expressions, and the Stream API
