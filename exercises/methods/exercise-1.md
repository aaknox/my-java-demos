Work on Your Own
================

Now that we’ve walked you through an exercise, it’s time for you to try one on your own. You can check your work at the end with our posted solution in the Reference section.

For this exercise, we want you to create a methods that should return a random number between 1 and 50, inclusively. This method should be called `randomNumber()`, it should be have a `public` access modifier and return an `int` datatype. It should not declare any parameters or exceptions. 

You'll need to use the Math class to generate a random number. It has a method called **random** that will return a value greater than or equal to 0.0 and less than 1.0. An example of its usage is below:

`double d = Math.random();`
