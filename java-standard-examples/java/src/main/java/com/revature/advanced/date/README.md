## Getting Started:
### Step 1
Explain the reasons for the new API including simplicity and thread safety.
### Step 2
Create the `Date` class and write the various methods.
> Recommendation: show the documentation for all the used methods from the `LocalDateTime` class. This helps associates learn to read the documentation, along with learning why we use particular methods.
### Step 3
Create the main method and run the class's methods to showcase the API.
