# java 8 - Predicate Example
## Purpose:
This example will showcase two well known functional interfaces: `Predicate` and `Consumer`. This will show associates the benefits of working with functional interfaces and lambdas. Lambdas and Streams should be covered before this example, and this will continue to expose associates to these topics.
## Topics:
* functional interfaces
* lambda
* stream api
* Predicate interface
* Consumer interface
## Resources:

## Getting Started:
### Step 1
Create the `PredicateExample` class with the main method.
### Step 2
Create the `predicateExample()` method, walking through the logic and explaining the `Predicate` interface and its usage. Run the method in the main method for demonstration.
### Step 3
Create the `consumerExample()` method, walking through the logic and explaining the `Consumer` interface and its usage. Run the method in the main method for demonstration.
