## Topics:

* Stream API
## Resources

## Getting Started:
### Step 1
Explain the Stream API and show documentation for the topic. Detail to associates the purpose of the API and its benefits.
### Step 2
Create the `Associate` class if it doesn't already exist (It is also used with the `Comparator` example with lambdas).
### Step 3
Create the `Stream` class and the main method.
### Step 4
Begin writing the various methods in the `Stream` class. With every method written, walk through the logic, run it with the main method, and potentially show documentation to elaborate on the topics. This will silo out each example.
### Step 5
For the `average()` and `sum()` methods, either create unit tests or use the main method to demonstrate.
