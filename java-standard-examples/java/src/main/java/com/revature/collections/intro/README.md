## Purpose:
This example is used to demonstrate the basics of the Collection API.
## Topics:
* Collections
* Lists, Sets, Maps, Queues
* Iterator
* Collections class
## Resources: 
[CollectionDriver:](https://gitlab.com/revature_training/java-team/-/blob/master/java-standard-examples/java/src/main/java/com/revature/collections/intro/CollectionDriver.java) `com.revature.collections.intro.CollectionDriver.java`

[User:](https://gitlab.com/revature_training/java-team/-/blob/master/java-standard-examples/java/src/main/java/com/revature/collections/intro/User.java) `com.revature.collections.intro.User.java`
## Getting Started:
### Step 1
Create the User class located in resources.
### Step 2
Create the CollectionDriver class and make a List of Users, Integers and Strings.
### Step 3
Use the Collections class to sort the integer and string lists. Show the Collections class docs to discuss the class' purpose and usage.
### Step 4
Make Sets, Queues and Maps of the different types and discuss their usage, purpose and difference.
### Step 5
Introduce the Iterator and use for each loops to iterate over the different collections. Make sure to show how to iterate over a map and discuss that the map is not iterable as itself. Talk about what you have to do to iterate over the map.
