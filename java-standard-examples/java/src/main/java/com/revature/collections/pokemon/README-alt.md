# Collections

## Purpose:

This is meant to give a final example of the Collection API. It will showcase the differences between the collections and reiterate the importance of each type.

## Topics:

* Collections
* Lists, Sets, Maps, Queues
* Comparable and Comparator
* Iterator
* Collections class

## Resources: 

[Pokemon:](https://gitlab.com/revature_training/java-team/-/blob/master/java-standard-examples/java/src/main/java/com/revature/collections/pokemon/Pokemon.java) `com.revature.collections.pokemon.Pokemon.java`

## Getting Started:

### Step 1

Create the `Pokemon` class and fill with necessary fields, getters, setters, etc.

### Step 2

Create the main method and create a collection of Pokemon.

### Step 3

Implement the `Comparable` interface and provide an implementation for the `compareTo()` method. Sort the `List` in the main 
method.

### Step 4

Create the helper classes either in their own file or inside the same one (trainers descretion). Use the `Collections.sort()` method with the helper classes to showcase using an instance of `Comparator`.

### Step 5

Use for each loops throughout the example and reiterate syntax and usage.

### Step 6

Continue the lesson creating different kinds of collections with `Pokemon` instances.
