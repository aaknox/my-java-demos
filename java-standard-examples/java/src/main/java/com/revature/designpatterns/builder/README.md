# Design Patterns - Builder
## Purpose:
This design pattern aims to clarify the instantiation of objects with numerous properties. This example will show how to achieve this pattern.
## Topics:
* Builder Design Pattern
* static nested classes
## Resources:
[Cake](https://gitlab.com/revature_training/java-team/-/blob/master/java-standard-examples/java/src/main/java/com/revature/designpatterns/builder/Cake.java) `com.revature.designpatterns.builder.Cake.java`

[BuilderDriver](https://gitlab.com/revature_training/java-team/-/blob/master/java-standard-examples/java/src/main/java/com/revature/designpatterns/builder/BuilderDriver.java) `com.revature.designpatterns.builder.BuilderDriver.java`
## Getting Started:
### Step 1
Create the `Cake` class and add instance fields and methods to the class.
### Step 2
Create the inner class `CakeBuilder` to the `Cake` class. Write the fields and methods of the class and explain the pattern in which they are made.
### Step 3
Create the `BuilderDriver` and demonstrate how instantiating a `Cake` object differs from instances of other classes.
### Step 4
Talk with associates about the advantages and disadvantages with this pattern. Ensure there is a clear understanding of the topic.
