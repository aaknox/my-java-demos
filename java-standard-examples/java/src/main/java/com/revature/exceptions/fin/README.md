# Finally
## Purpose:
This example will demonstrate all the times that finally will and will not run.
## Topics:
* finally
* Errors
* Exceptions
## Resources:
[FinallyExamples:](https://gitlab.com/revature_training/java-team/-/blob/master/java-standard-examples/java/src/main/java/com/revature/exceptions/fin/FinallyExamples.java) `com.revature.exceptions.fin.FinallyExamples.java`
## Getting Started:
### Step 1
Explain the usage of finally and create the `FinallyExamples` class.
### Step 2
Talk about the `System.exit()` method, what it does, and how finally will not execute when it is called.
### Step 3
Create the `finallyTest()` method and call it in the main method with different arguments to show when finally executes.
### Step 4
Talk about errors and discuss the difference between them and exceptions along with the difference when it comes to handling exceptions vs errors.
### Step 5
Create the `outOfMemoryTest()` and `stackOverflowTest()` to show that finally runs even when errors are thrown.
