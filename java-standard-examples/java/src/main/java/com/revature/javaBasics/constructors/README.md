# Constructors
## Purpose:
By the end of the lesson, associates should be able to write constructors and show competency in the topics.
## Topics:
* The reason for constructors
* The order in which they are called
* Overloading constructors
* Constructor chaining
* The use of `this` and `super`

## Getting Started:
### Step 1
Create classes `A`, `B`, and `C`.
### Step 2
Extend the classes as in the examples
### Step 3
Follow the class structures for the classes and demonstrate the use of super and overloading constructors
> Note: Detail to associates how the call to super() is made, even if it isn't specifically written in the constructor.
> Note: Challenge associates to use super() and this() in a variety of ways to emphasize when/where it can/cannot be called (only on first line, infinite recursion of this(), etc.).
### Step 4
Explain the different types of constructors and the difference between a no args and default constructor
### Step 5
Explain the relationship between inheritance and method hiding
### Step 6
Create the `Chaining` class and introduce constructor chaining and the difference between it and using the new keyword. Explain how they are not the same.
