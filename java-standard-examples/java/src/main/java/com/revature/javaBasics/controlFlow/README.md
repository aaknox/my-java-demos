# Control Flow
## Purpose:
These examples will introduce associates to control flow and implement a small grade calculator example to demonstrate the topics.
## Topics:
* if/else statements
* switch statements
* for loops
* while loops
* do-while loops
* for each loops
* command line arguments with the ide

## Getting Started:
### Step 1
Explain what control flow is and why it is necessary for programs.
### Step 2
Use `Control.java` and `ControlFlow.java` for demonstrating control flow. Walk through the flow logic and keywords like `break` and `continue`.
### Step 3
Use `LoopsExample` to demonstrate looping and the different kinds of loops.
### Step 4
Create the `GradeCalculator` example with the associates and explain the usage of command line arguments (use the ide to show how to give the program command line arguments. This topic should have been covered while going over java command).
### Step 5
Using the `GradeCalculator` example, reiterate topics including for each loops and varargs.
