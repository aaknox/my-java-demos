# `Wrapper Classes`
## Topics: 
* wrapper classes
* autoboxing / unboxing

## Resources:
[source:](https://gitlab.com/revature_training/java-team/-/blob/master/java-standard-examples/java/src/main/java/com/revature/javaBasics/wrapperclasses/WrapperClasses.java) `com.revature.javaBasics.wrapperclasses.WrapperClasses.java`
## Getting Started
### Step 1
Explain the size of each primitive and the reason for needing an object representation of them in wrapper classes. Talk about type casting and over/underflow.
### Step 2
Use the source file located in the resources section to assist in explaining auto/unboxing and comparing primitives to wrapper objects.
### Step 3
Demonstrate overloading methods with primitives and wrapper objects. Show how the primitives will autobox into the necessary arguments and the rules regarding how and when it does this (int will cast to Integer but not to Long).
### Step 4
Talk about how to use wrapper classes to parse primitives out of Strings and the exceptions associated with it.
