# Reflections
## Purpose:
This example will introduce associates to the Reflection API and the various ways we can interact with classes at runtime.
## Topics:
* Reflection API
## Resources:
[Reflection](https://gitlab.com/revature_training/java-team/-/blob/master/java-standard-examples/java/src/main/java/com/revature/reflections/intro/Reflection.java) `com.revature.reflections.intro.Reflection.java`

[Frankenstein](https://gitlab.com/revature_training/java-team/-/blob/master/java-standard-examples/java/src/main/java/com/revature/reflections/intro/Frankenstein.java) `com.revature.reflections.intro.Frankenstein.java`
## Getting Started:
### Step 1
Create the `Frankenstein` class.
### Step 2
Explain the need to examine and possibly change properties and methods on the class during runtime.
### Step 3
Create the `Reflection` class.
### Step 4
Use the main method to instantiate an instance of the `Frankensein` class. Use the setters and various methods to demonstrate the usage of the object.
### Step 5
Use the various methods in the API such as `getDeclaredMethods()`, `getMethods()` and `getDeclaredFields()` and explain their purpose and usage.
