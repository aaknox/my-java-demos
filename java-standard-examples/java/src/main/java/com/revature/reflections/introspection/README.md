# Reflection - RunIntrospection example
## Purpose:
This will demonstrate to associates the ability to access methods of a class during runtime access properties of that method such as parameter types.
## Topics:
* Reflection API
* accessing methods on a class
## Resources:
[InspectMe](https://gitlab.com/revature_training/java-team/-/blob/master/java-standard-examples/java/src/main/java/com/revature/reflections/introspection/InspectMe.java) `com.revature.reflections.introspection.InspectMe.java`

[RunIntrospection](https://gitlab.com/revature_training/java-team/-/blob/master/java-standard-examples/java/src/main/java/com/revature/reflections/introspection/RunInspection.java) `com.revature.reflections.introspection.RunIntrospection.java`
## Getting Started:
### Step 1
Create the `InspectMe` class and build the various methods.
### Step 2
Create the `RunIntrospection` class and create the `invokeDualIntegerMethod` method.
### Step 3
Build the method with them and explain the logic step by step to illustrate what reflections is doing for us.
### Step 4
Build the main method and run the program to show the end result of the example.
