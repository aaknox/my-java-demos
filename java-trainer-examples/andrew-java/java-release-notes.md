* APIs for creating Unmodifiable Collections
* System Property to Disable JRE Last Usage Tracking
* Bytecode Generation for Enhanced for Loop

  * Create minimal runtime image optimized for your app
* JShell - interactive Java REPL
  * Can launch from command line (`jshell`)
* Javadoc improvements (search and HTML 5 compliant)
* Collection factory methods
  * Directly populate collections: `Set<Integer> ints = Set.of(1, 2, 3);`

Java 8 was a big release with many new additions to the Java Standard Library. Some highlights include:
* `.forEach()` method in `Iterable` interface
* default and static methods in interfaces
* Functional interfaces and Lambda expressions
* Java Stream API (under `java.util.stream`) for bulk data operations on Collections
* Java Date and Time API (under `java.time`)
  *  `java.time.format` and `java.time.zone` sub-packages for formatting and working with time zones
  * `DateTimeFormatter` class for converting datetime objects to strings
* Collection API improvements
  * `Iterator` default method `forEachRemaining(Consumer action)`
  * `Collection` default method `removeIf(Predicate filter)`
  * `Collection` method `spliterator()` that returns `Spliterator` instance
  * `Map` methods `replaceAll()`, `compute()`, and `merge()`
* Concurrency API improvements
  * `ConcurrencyHashMap` methods `compute()`, `forEachEntry()`, `forEachKey()`, `forEachValue()`, `merge()`, `reduce()`, and `search()`
  * `CompletableFuture` that may be explicitly completed

## Java 7
[Official documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/)

Java 7 highlights:
* Diamond operator for type inference
  * Old syntax: `Map<String, List<Trade>> trades = new TreeMap<String, List<Trade>> ();`
  * New syntax: `Map<String, List<Trade>> trades = new TreeMap <> ();`
* Using `String`s in `switch` statements
* Automatic resource management with try-with-resources
  * New syntax: `try(resource){...}` will automatically close the resource
  * Resources to be auto-closed must implement the `java.lang.AutoCloseable` interface
* Numeric literals with underscores
  * `int million  =  1_000_000`
* Multi-catch block
  * `try {...} catch(ExceptionOne | ExceptionTwo | ExceptionThree e) {...}`
* File system API improvements (`java.nio` package)
* Fork and Join - `ForkJoinPool` and `ForkJoinTask`
* Support for dynamic languages
  * New package: `java.lang.invoke`

## Java 6
[Official documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/)

Java 6 highlights:
* Scripting language support
* Java Compiler API

## Java 5
[Official documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/)

Java 5 highlights:
* For-each loops (enhanced for loops)
  * `for(data_type variable : array | collection) {...}`
* Variable arguments (varargs)
  * `public void methodname(String p1, String ...otherParams) {...}` or `public void methodname(String p1, String... otherParams) {...}`
* Static imports
* Auto-boxing and unboxing
* Enumerations (`enum`s)
* Covariant return types
* Annotations
* Generics - improved type safety
