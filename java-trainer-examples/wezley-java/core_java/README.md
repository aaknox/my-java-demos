# Core Java Example Overview

Week 1 examples are pretty straightforward in this set, each day has its own Java project.


These projects are broken down into several driver classes, each of which cover a specific topic (or a group of closely related topics). The projects associated with each day do not exactly match up to the official Java/MS curriculum, but they are pretty close.


## Day 1 demos


- IntroDriver.java
    + primitive data types
    + literal suffixes
    + System class
    + light intro to String class
    + wrapper classes
    + autoboxing/unboxing

- OperatorDriver.java
    + unary operators
    + arithmetic operators
    + relational operators
    + logical operators (short-circuit AND/OR operators)
    + bitwise operators (AND/OR/XOR)
    + assignment operators
    + declaring values in different bases (binary, hexadecimal, octal)

- PersonDriver.java and Person.java
    + POJO design pattern
    + classes and objects
    + instance variables
    + class variables
    + default and no-args constructors
    + super() and this()
    + overloaded constructors
    + instance methods
    + static methods
    + overloaded methods
    + instantiating objects


## Day 2 Demos

- ArrayDriver.java
    + primitive arrays
    + for-each loop
    + multi-dimensional arrays

- ControlDriver.java
    + decision-making statements (if, if else, switch)
    + looping statements (for, while, do while)
    + branching statements (break and continue)
    + switch fall through

- ScopeDriver.java
    + variable scopes
    + pass by value

- StaticDriver.java and MyStaticClassMembers.java
    + static imports

- VarArgsDriver.java
    + variable arguments (single and multi-dimensional)

- StringDriver.java
    + String API
    + String Pool
    + String immutability

- Driver.java, Person.java, and Skill.java
    + variable scopes
    + NullPointerException
    + Enums
