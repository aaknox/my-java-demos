	 * Constructors
	 * 
	 * A constructor is a block of code, similar to a method, that is called when an instance of an object is created.
	 * Constructors do not have return types, and the name of the constructor must match the name of the class.
	 * 
	 * Constructors do not have to have a specific access modifier, although typically they are declared as public. However,
	 * there are specific instances in which a non-public constructor would be desired (i.e. singleton design pattern).
	 * 
	 * The very first line of every constructor is 'super();' implicitly, even if it is not typed. The only acceptable replacement
	 * is 'this();'.
	 * 
	 * 		super() - calls the no-args constructor of the parent class (this can be passed a value to call any overloaded constructors)
	 * 		
	 * 		this() - calls the no-args constructor of the current class (this can be passed a value to call any overloaded constructors)
