This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life. You need the dark in order to show the light. 
We wash our brush with odorless thinner. I guess that would be considered a UFO. A big cotton ball in the sky. 
Now, we're going to fluff this cloud.

Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and 
having a snow-covered dinner. I'm gonna start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue Let's get 
wild today. All kinds of happy little splashes. This is your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go 
crazy.

You can create anything that makes you happy. With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way. Maybe there's 
a happy little Evergreen that lives here.

Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections. There are no limits in this world. We'll do another happy 
little painting.
