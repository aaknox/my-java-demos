/*
 *The Dining Philosophers problem is one of the classic problems used
 * to describe synchronization issues in a multithreaded environment
 * and illustrate techniques for solving them.
 *
 * There are five silent philosophers (P1 � P5) sitting around a circular
 * table, spending their lives eating and thinking.
 *
 * There are five forks for them to share (1 � 5) and to be able to eat,
 * a philosopher needs to have forks in both his hands. After eating, he
 * puts both of them down and then they can be picked by another philosopher
 * who repeats the same cycle.
 *
 * The goal is to come up with a protocol that helps the philosophers achieve
 * their goal of eating and thinking without starving to death (which will happen
 * if they deadlock).
