# Exercise 1

Follow the same process that we did with `fibonacci()` and create a class Factorial and a method `factorial()` to return the nth factorial number.

Your method signature should be:

```java
    public int factorial(int n)
```

Assume that `n` is a positive integer, where n > 0;

Recall that a factorial is N \* (N - 1) \* (N -2) \* â€¦ \* N - (N - 1).
