Work on Your Own
================

Now that we've walked you through an exercise, it's time for you to try one on your own.Â 

**Exercise 1**

For this exercise, you need to write a while loop that prints the numbers 1 through 10, inclusively each on a separate line.

**HINT**: You can use a variable that you increase during each iteration (step) of the loop. You can also use an if-statement to determine when to exit the loop.

**Exercise 2**

For this exercise, you must write a while loop that prints all of the even numbers 100 to -100, inclusively, each on a separate line.
