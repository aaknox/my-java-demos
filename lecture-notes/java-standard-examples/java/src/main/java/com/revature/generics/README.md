# Generics
## Purpose:
This will provide associates' insight into the generics topic. Here, you will create a simple class using generics and isntantiate it within another class' main method.
## Topics:
* Generics
## Resources:
[GenericClass](https://gitlab.com/revature_training/java-team/-/blob/master/java-standard-examples/java/src/main/java/com/revature/generics/GenericClass.java) `com.revature.generics.GenericClass.java`

[GenericDriver](https://gitlab.com/revature_training/java-team/-/blob/master/java-standard-examples/java/src/main/java/com/revature/generics/GenericDriver.java) `com.revature.generics.GenericDriver.java`

## Getting Started:
### Step 1
Discuss the need for Generics and talk the potential for `ClassCastException` without them. Talk about the introduction of Generics into the Java language and what we had to do prior to its' introduction.
### Step 2
Create the `GenericDriver` and create the main method. Create a List with and without generics to show the difference between before and after generic's introduction.
### Step 3
Create the `GenericClass` and discuss the syntax for creating a class that uses generics.
### Step 4
Instantiate the `GenericClass` inside the main method of `GenericDriver` and discuss the syntax for doing so.
