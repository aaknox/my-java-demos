## Getting Started
### Step 1
Explain what an array is. Notes are inside the source file found in the resources section.
### Step 2
Go over the different ways to declare an array. `int[] arr` and `int arr[]`.
### Step 3
Talk about the different ways to instantiate an array.
### Step 4
Explain how we can create arrays of primitives and of objects.
### Step 5
Explain what happens when we attempt to access an array element that is outside the indexes of the array.
### Step 6
Show the different ways to iterate over arrays with both a traditional and an enhanced for loop.
### Step 7
Explain two dimensional arrays and how to access them
### Step 8
Show how to iterate over a two dimensional array with a nested for loop.
