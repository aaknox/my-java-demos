# `Datatypes`
## Purpose:
This is mean to give an introduction to the primitive datatypes and what default values they are given
and under what situations they are given them. This is also meant to give exposure to the different
scopes of java.
## Topics: 
 * primitives vs objects
 * default values
 * instance variables
 * java scopes
## Resources:

## Getting Started
 ### Step 1
Explain how Java has primitive and reference datatypes and go over the difference between them when it comes to the stack and heap.
 ### Step 2
Go over references as it pertains to the stack and heap.
 ### Step 3
List the different primitive datatypes.
 ### Step 4
Talk about scopes and default values using the provided example in the resources section.
 ### Step 5
Talk about when the types do not get default values and how different arrays are.
