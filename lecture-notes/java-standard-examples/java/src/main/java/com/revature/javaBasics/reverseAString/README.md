# `Reverse A String`
## Purpose:
This is an example of reversing a string as a basic introduction to working with algorithms and the String class.

  ## Topics: 
  * problem solving 
  * `.charAt()` 
  * Strings

  ## What this example does
Reverses a String using only the `.charAt()` method
  ## Getting Started
Have the associates use their IDE's for working through this algorithm. This will help them get more comfortable with their IDE and with programming.

This is IDE agnostic, so there is no other setup than that of the IDE, which should have already been done.
  ### Step 1
Assign this as a problem for associates to solve, and let them come up with the algorithm
  ### Step 2
Once the associates are finished, have one of them show their solution and walk through the algorithm and how he/she came up with the solution.
  ### Step3
Talk about basic problem solving techniques and how we can use these as basic building blocks to solving real world problems in programming.
  ### Step 4
Use the associated unit tests to show associates how to test their solution
