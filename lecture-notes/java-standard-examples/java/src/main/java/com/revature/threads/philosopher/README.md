# Threads - DiningPhilosophersProblem
## Purpose:
This example will showcase the use and advantage of threads while also teaching the dining philosopher problem. This can be issued to associates as an assignment with this example being used as a guide for a solution.
## Topics:
* Threads
* `Runnable` Interface
* Dining Philosopher Problem
## Resources:
[Philosopher](https://gitlab.com/revature_training/java-team/-/blob/master/java-standard-examples/java/src/main/java/com/revature/threads/philosopher/Philosopher.java) `com.revature.threads.philosopher.Philosopher.java`

## Getting Started:
### Step 1
Explain the dining philosopher problem, the problems presented, and potential solutions.
### Step 2
Write the `Philosopher` class while connecting the properties and methods to the problem.
> This helps associates begin connecting the dissection of a problem to the design and assembly of the program.
### Step 3
Create the `DiningPhilosophersProblem` class and create the main method.
### Step 4
Walk through the logic of the main method and run the program to demonstrate the problems associated with concurrency.
