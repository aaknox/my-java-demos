## Prerequisites & Learning Objectives

Before starting with the material in this module, associates should be familiar with:
* General programming concepts - control flow statements, basic data structures and algorithms
* IDE setup should be complete

After completing all the modules in this repository, associates should be able to:
* Explain the benefits and drawbacks of Java as a programming language relative to other languages
* Understand Java's static type system
* Explain the role of the JDK, JRE, and JVM in developing, compiling, and running Java code
* Explain the difference between objects and classes
* Explain what the Stack and Heap are and where objects, reference variables, and primitives are stored
* Describe Strings, understand the String API, and explain how Strings are stored in the String pool
* Explain the difference between `String`, `StringBuilder`, and `StringBuffer` as well as know how to utilize each
* Explain what packages are, how and when to import a type, as well as how and when to appropriately use static imports
* Name the primitive data types in Java along with their bit sizes, as well as their corresponding wrapper classes
* Create classes, interfaces, and enums
* Write syntactically correct Java code, compile it, and run the program on the command line
* Name and explain all control flow statements: `for`, `for-each`, `while`, `do-while`, `if/else`, and `switch`
* Explain Java's access modifiers: `public`, `private`, `protected`, and `default`
* Explain the (basic) non-access modifiers: `static`, `final`, `abstract`
* Explain the scopes in which a variable can be declared
* Define constructors for classes, understand the default no-arg constructor, the `super` and `this` keywords, and constructor chaining
* Define `static` and instance methods which accept arguments
* Understand and utilize `varargs` syntax as a method parameter
* Recognize and comprehend unary, binary, and ternary operators
* Explain the difference between pre-increment and post-increment operators
* Explain what an array in Java is, how to declare and initialize one, as well as accessing and modifying array elements
* Understand the role of the `Object` class and list all its methods
* Explain what annotations are, why they are important, their syntax, as well as identify and explain basic annotations like `@Deprecated` or `@Override`
* Recognize the difference between references variables and objects when analyzing code - give a count for each given a code snippet
* Explain the garbage collection process, as well as when objects become eligible for garbage collection
* Write well-documented code with Javadocs, and use code comments appropriately
* Follow naming conventions for writing Java code
