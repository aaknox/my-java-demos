* [Exercises](./exercises.md)

## List of Topics

* Inheritance
* Abstraction
* Encapsulation
* Polymorphism

## Prerequisites & Learning Objectives

Before starting with the material in this module, associates should be familiar with:
* General programming concepts - control flow statements, basic data structures and algorithms
* IDE setup should be complete

After completing all the modules in this repository, associates should be able to:
* Explain what object-oriented programming means and how it differs from other programming paradigms
* Comprehend and explain in detail each of the OOP principles
* Write Java code that utilizes all OOP principles
  * Abstract away implementation details with abstract classes and interfaces
  * Encapsulate state and behavior into beans
  * Remove code duplication through inheritance
  * Achieve flexibility through overloading and overriding (virtual method invocation)
* Understand the importance and difference between abstract classes and interfaces
* Explain the difference between static, compile-time polymorphism and dynamic, run-time polymorphism
* Comprehend and apply method overloading and overriding
* Explain virtual method invocation
* Explain co-variant return types
