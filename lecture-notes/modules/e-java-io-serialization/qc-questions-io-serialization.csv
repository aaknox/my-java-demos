,Serialization,How do you serialize / deserialize an object in Java?,"a. Step 1: An object is marked serializable by implementing the `java.io.Serializable` interface, which signifies to the underlying API that the object can be flattened into bytes and subsequently inflated in the future.
b. Step 2: The next step is to actually persist the object. That is done with the `java.io.ObjectOutputStream` class. That class is a filter stream--it is wrapped around a lower-level byte stream (called a node stream) to handle the serialization protocol for us. Node streams can be used to write to file systems or even across sockets. That means we could easily transfer a flattened object across a network wire and have it be rebuilt on the other side!
c. To restore the object back, you use `ObjectInputStream.readObject()` method call. The method call reads in the raw bytes that we previously persisted and creates a live object that is an exact replica of the original. Because `readObject()` can read any serializable object, a cast to the correct type is required. With that in mind, the class file must be accessible from the system in which the restoration occurs. In other words, the object's class file and methods are not saved; only the object's state is saved."
,Serialization,What are transient variables?,Transient variables are those variables which cannot be serialized.
