## Collections Module

The purpose of this module is to explore and explain the Collections API, including the class & interface hierarchy, concrete implementations, and related concepts like Generics, Iterators, and the Comparator and Comparable interfaces.

## Prerequisites & Learning Objectives

Before starting with the material in this module, associates should be familiar with:
* IDE setup should be complete
* Java syntax and control flow

After completing all the modules in this repository, associates should be able to:
* Describe the Collections API class hierarchy
* Describe the features of the List, Set, Queue, and Map interfaces
* Describe the differences between concrete implementations of Collection interfaces
* Know when to utilize each data structure - i.e. explain the advantages / disadvantages of each implementation
* Use a specified collection data type to implement a simple algorithm to solve business logic problems
* Explain the importance and relevance of Generics, especially relating to Collections
* Define a natural ordering for a class using the `Comparable` interface
* Define a custom ordering for a class uing the `Comparator` interface
* Write a `for-each` loop to iterate over an `Iterable`
* Retrieve and utilize `Iterator`s from a collection to iterate through
