* Creating custom annotations
* Java 7
  * `try-with-resources` and the `AutoCloseable` interface
  * `java.nio` package
  * Diamond operator (`<>`) - type inference
  * Numeric literals with underscores
* Java 8
  * Date & Time API
  * Functional interfaces, Lambda expressions, and the `Predicate` interface
  * Stream API
  * `Optional` class
  * `.forEach` method in the `Iterable` interface

  * Method references syntax (`Class:method`)
* Inner classes
  * Local classes
  * Anonymous classes

## Prerequisites & Learning Objectives

Before starting with the material in this module, associates should be familiar with:
* IDE setup should be complete
* Core Java
* OOP basics
* Collections
* Exceptions
* I/O - Serialization

After completing all the modules in this repository, associates should be able to:
* Utilize wildcards and upper/lower-bounded type parameters in generics
* Create generic classes and types
* Create custom annotations
* Name and explain the major new features of Java 7 and 8
* Use lambda expressions to implement functional interfaces on the fly
  * Use lambdas with the Stream API
  * Use lambdas with the `Comparator` interface
* Define functional programming
* Describe the properties of Streams within the Stream API
* Explain what *intermediate* and *terminal* operations are
* Use Stream API methods to define functional-style operations on streams of elements
* Describe and utilize the `Optional` class and its methods in defensive programming
* Iterate over and `Iterable` using the `.forEach` method
* Explain and use inner classes appropriately
* Explain the purpose of regular expressions
* Utilize `Pattern` and `Matcher` classes to match a regular expression with a string
* Utilize the `Locale` class for internationalization
