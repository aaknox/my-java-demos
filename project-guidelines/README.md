* Make sure to follow all project requirements to fully assess your skills in using the technologies that you have learned from lecture.
* Tips:
    - If you get stuck on a problem, turn to Google, StackOverflow, or YouTube to resolve your problem before asking your trainer for help. This is important as in the real world it will be up to you to resolve your problems that you come across as you are coding/debugging.
    - Also reach to other cohort members if you get stuck. **DO NOT** copy each other's code (this violates Revature's code of standards and may subject you to disciplinary actions and/or dismissal from training).
    * Turn to offical documentation for Java, SQL, etc. if you don't know how certain functionalities/keywords work.
